## ‚ùì What is NgRx?

NgRx is a state management library for Angular applications, inspired by Redux and powered by RxJS. It enables reactive, centralized, and immutable state management.

It provides a single source of truth for your application data and helps manage side effects like HTTP calls in a clean and testable way.

---

## ‚ùì Why Do You Need NgRx?

As Angular applications grow, managing state through services and component bindings becomes complex.

NgRx helps by:

- Centralizing state in a global store  
- Making state changes predictable  
- Enabling time-travel debugging  
- Enforcing immutability  
- Simplifying testing  
- Separating state management logic from components  

---

## ‚úÖ Best Use Cases for NgRx

### When to use NgRx:

- Large applications with complex shared state  
- Apps requiring undo/redo, logging, or state persistence  
- Applications with heavy side-effect operations  
- Teams working on large codebases needing a structured pattern  

### When not to use NgRx:

- Small apps with simple state needs  
- Quick prototypes or MVPs  
- When services and local component state suffice  

---

## üèõÔ∏è NgRx Architectural Pattern

NgRx is based on the Redux pattern and follows unidirectional data flow.

Component ‚Üí dispatch(Action) ‚Üí Reducer ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Component  
                             ‚Üì  
                          Effect (for side effects like HTTP requests)

Core building blocks:

- Actions: Describe what happened  
- Reducers: Handle how state changes  
- Store: Centralized application state container  
- Effects: Handle asynchronous logic (e.g., API calls)  
- Selectors: Retrieve specific slices of state  

---

## üß† NgRx Core Concepts

### 1. Actions

```ts

import { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store'  
import { User } from '../models/user.model'  

export const loadUsers = createAction('[User] Load Users')  
export const loadUsersSuccess = createAction('[User] Load Users Success', props<{ users: User[] }>())
```

---

### 2. Reducers

```ts
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store'  
import { loadUsers, loadUsersSuccess } from './user.actions'  
import { User } from '../models/user.model'  

export interface UserState {  
  users: User[]  
  loading: boolean  
}  

export const initialState: UserState = {  
  users: [],  
  loading: false  
}  

export const userReducer = createReducer(  
  initialState,  
  on(loadUsers, state => ({ ...state, loading: true })),  
  on(loadUsersSuccess, (state, { users }) => ({ ...state, users, loading: false }))  
)
```
---

### 3. Selectors

```ts
import { createFeatureSelector, createSelector } from '@ngrx/store'  
import { UserState } from './user.reducer'  

export const selectUserState = createFeatureSelector<UserState>('user')  
export const selectUsers = createSelector(selectUserState, state => state.users)  
export const selectLoading = createSelector(selectUserState, state => state.loading)
```
---

### 4. Effects

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'  
import { Actions, createEffect, ofType } from '@ngrx/effects'  
import { UserService } from '../services/user.service'  
import { loadUsers, loadUsersSuccess } from './user.actions'  
import { switchMap, map } from 'rxjs/operators'  

@Injectable()  
export class UserEffects {  
  constructor(private actions$: Actions, private userService: UserService) {}  

  loadUsers$ = createEffect(() =>  
    this.actions$.pipe(  
      ofType(loadUsers),  
      switchMap(() =>  
        this.userService.getUsers().pipe(  
          map(users => loadUsersSuccess({ users }))  
        )  
      )  
    )  
  )  
}
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up NgRx in an Angular Application

Install the required NgRx packages using Angular CLI.

```ts
ng add @ngrx/store  
ng add @ngrx/effects  
ng add @ngrx/store-devtools  
ng add @ngrx/entity  
ng add @ngrx/router-store  

```
---

## üß™ Step-by-Step NgRx Example

### 1. Create a User Model

```ts
export interface User {  
  id: number  
  name: string  
}
```

---

### 2. Define Actions

See the Actions section.

---

### 3. Create Reducer

See the Reducers section.

---

### 4. Create Selectors

See the Selectors section.

---

### 5. Create Effects

See the Effects section.

---

### 6. Register Store and Effects in App Module

```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'  
import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store'  
import { EffectsModule } from '@ngrx/effects'  
import { userReducer } from './store/user.reducer'  
import { UserEffects } from './store/user.effects'  

@NgModule({  
  imports: [  
    StoreModule.forRoot({ user: userReducer }),  
    EffectsModule.forRoot([UserEffects])  
  ]  
})  
export class AppModule {}
```
---

### 7. Use Store in Component

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'  
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store'  
import { Observable } from 'rxjs'  
import { loadUsers } from './store/user.actions'  
import { selectUsers, selectLoading } from './store/user.selectors'  
import { User } from './models/user.model'  

@Component({  
  selector: 'app-users',  
  templateUrl: './users.component.html'  
})  
export class UsersComponent implements OnInit {  
  users$: Observable<User[]> = this.store.select(selectUsers)  
  loading$: Observable<boolean> = this.store.select(selectLoading)  

  constructor(private store: Store) {}  

  ngOnInit(): void {  
    this.store.dispatch(loadUsers())  
  }  
}

```

---

## üîÑ Migrating an Existing Angular App to Use NgRx

1. Identify shared or global state  
2. Create a store folder per feature module  
3. Move business logic from services to effects  
4. Replace service calls in components with dispatching actions  
5. Use selectors to access state instead of local variables  
6. Update AppModule or feature modules to register store and effects  

---

## ‚ùì Does NgRx Reduce Backend Calls?

NgRx does not automatically reduce backend calls, but you can implement caching logic using selectors and effects.

### Example: Only fetch users if not already loaded

```ts

loadUsers$ = createEffect(() =>  
  this.actions$.pipe(  
    ofType(loadUsers),  
    withLatestFrom(this.store.select(selectUsers)),  
    filter(([_, users]) => users.length === 0),  
    switchMap(() =>  
      this.userService.getUsers().pipe(  
        map(users => loadUsersSuccess({ users }))  
      )  
    )  
  )  
)
```

## The Problem: Stale Data in the Store

If the cache is never invalidated or refreshed, new or updated data from the backend will never be reloaded once the store has been populated. This is especially problematic when:

- A new user is added
- A user is updated or deleted elsewhere
- The data becomes stale over time

---

## Solution: Cache Invalidation / Store Refresh Strategy

We can add a refresh mechanism to invalidate the cache or re-fetch data when specific events occur ‚Äî e.g., when a new user is added.

---

### Strategy: Refresh Users List When a New User is Added

### 1. Define a new action:

```ts
export const addUser = createAction('[User] Add User', props<{ user: User }>())
export const addUserSuccess = createAction('[User] Add User Success', props<{ user: User }>())
```

---

### 2. Add an effect to handle addUser and dispatch a loadUsers on success:

```ts
addUser$ = createEffect(() =>
  this.actions$.pipe(
    ofType(addUser),
    switchMap(({ user }) =>
      this.userService.addUser(user).pipe(
        map((newUser) => addUserSuccess({ user: newUser }))
      )
    )
  )
)

refreshUsersAfterAdd$ = createEffect(() =>
  this.actions$.pipe(
    ofType(addUserSuccess),
    map(() => loadUsers())
  )
)
```

---

### 3. Modify your loadUsers$ effect to always load, or conditionally load based on a flag:

#### Option A: Always Load

```ts
loadUsers$ = createEffect(() =>  
  this.actions$.pipe(  
    ofType(loadUsers),  
    switchMap(() =>  
      this.userService.getUsers().pipe(  
        map(users => loadUsersSuccess({ users }))  
      )  
    )  
  )  
)
```

#### Option B: Use a forceRefresh flag in the action

Update your action:

```ts
export const loadUsers = createAction(
  '[User] Load Users',
  props<{ forceRefresh?: boolean }>()
)
```

Update your effect:

```ts
loadUsers$ = createEffect(() =>
  this.actions$.pipe(
    ofType(loadUsers),
    withLatestFrom(this.store.select(selectUsers)),
    filter(([action, users]) => action.forceRefresh || users.length === 0),
    switchMap(() =>
      this.userService.getUsers().pipe(
        map(users => loadUsersSuccess({ users }))
      )
    )
  )
)
```

Then, in your refreshUsersAfterAdd$ effect:

```ts
refreshUsersAfterAdd$ = createEffect(() =>
  this.actions$.pipe(
    ofType(addUserSuccess),
    map(() => loadUsers({ forceRefresh: true }))
  )
)
```

---

## Alternative Strategy: Use ngrx/entity and Update Store Manually

If you're using @ngrx/entity, you can add the user directly to the entity adapter in your reducer instead of refetching the entire list.

In user.reducer.ts:

```ts
on(addUserSuccess, (state, { user }) =>
  adapter.addOne(user, state)
)
```

This avoids a network call by updating the store directly. However, this assumes the backend successfully added the user and returned the full object.

Use this if:

- You trust the backend‚Äôs response  
- You don‚Äôt need to reload the full list  

---

## Summary: Keeping Store Updated with Fresh Data

| Strategy                  | Description                                      | When to Use                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Force load after action  | Re-dispatch loadUsers() after addUserSuccess     | Ensures fresh data, good for cache invalidation |
| Use forceRefresh flag     | Toggle reloading based on condition              | More control, avoids unnecessary calls |
| Directly update store    | Use @ngrx/entity to add/remove in reducer        | Efficient, avoids backend call, but risks stale data |
| Time-based refresh       | Set up an interval to refresh state              | Good for real-time scenarios         |

---

## Final Tip

Centralize your logic for refreshing or invalidating the cache inside Effects ‚Äî the components should remain dumb and only dispatch actions or select state.

Would you like a complete working example of this pattern with @ngrx/entity included?

## ‚úÖ NgRx Tips and Best Practices

- Use createFeature for feature-based state slices  
- Use ngrx/entity for managing collections  
- Normalize state for better performance  
- Use selectors to encapsulate state access  
- Keep reducers pure and simple  
- Handle loading, success, and error states in your store  
- Use strong typing for actions, state, and selectors  
- Use Store DevTools for debugging and time-travel inspection  
- Avoid duplicating logic across components and services  
- Group NgRx files by feature (e.g., actions.ts, reducer.ts, selectors.ts, effects.ts)  
- Use feature modules with forFeature to keep state modular  

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

NgRx is a powerful state management solution for Angular applications. It introduces a structured approach to managing complex state, handling side effects, and keeping logic centralized and testable.

While it comes with a learning curve and some boilerplate, the benefits for large-scale applications are immense ‚Äî especially when multiple teams work on a shared codebase.

Use NgRx when:

- Your state is shared and complex  
- You need to manage side effects like HTTP calls  
- You want to debug and test business logic easily  
- Your team needs consistency and scalability  

Avoid NgRx when:

- Your app is small and doesn‚Äôt require shared state  
- You only use local component state or simple services  

Adopt NgRx gradually by migrating one feature at a time. Start with a simple slice of state, then expand as needed.

With best practices and modular structure, NgRx can make your Angular apps more maintainable, scalable, and robust.
