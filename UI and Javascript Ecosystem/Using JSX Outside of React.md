# Using JSX Outside of React

While JSX is most commonly associated with React, it can also be used outside of the React ecosystem. JSX, at its core, is just a **syntax extension** for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code. Under the hood, JSX gets compiled into plain JavaScript, which means it can technically be used in any JavaScript environment with the right tools.

In this guide, we'll explore how JSX can be utilized outside of React and provide examples using libraries like **Preact**, **Vue**, and even vanilla JavaScript.

## 1. JSX with Preact

### What is Preact?

[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is a lightweight alternative to React that offers similar functionality but with a smaller footprint (~3KB). It supports JSX out of the box, making it an excellent choice if you want to use JSX without the full weight of React.

**Example:** 

```jsx
import { h, render } from 'preact';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from Preact!</h1>
      <p>This is JSX in action without React.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```  

**Explanation:**  
- `h` is Preact's version of `React.createElement`. 
-  The `render` function mounts the component onto the DOM.
-  This example shows how JSX works seamlessly with Preact, allowing you to build UI components similarly to React.

### Why Use Preact?
- **Lightweight:** Preact is much smaller than React, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.
- **Familiar API:** If you're already familiar with React, switching to Preact is straightforward.

## 2. JSX with Vue (via @vue/babel-preset-jsx)  

### What is Vue?

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is another popular front-end framework that primarily uses templates for building UIs. However, Vue also supports JSX via the `@vue/babel-preset-jsx` package, enabling developers to write components using JSX syntax.


**Example:** 
First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install vue @vue/babel-preset-jsx
``` 
Then, create a Vue component using JSX:

```jsx
import Vue from 'vue';

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello from Vue with JSX!</h1>
        <p>JSX in Vue is possible with the right configuration.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```  

**Explanation:**  
- The `render()` method in Vue allows you to return JSX instead of a template.
- You need to configure Babel with the `@vue/babel-preset-jsx` preset to enable JSX support in Vue.

### Why Use JSX in Vue?
- `Flexibility:` JSX offers more flexibility than Vue’s template syntax, especially when working with complex logic inside your components.
- `Familiarity:` Developers coming from React may prefer JSX over Vue’s templating syntax.

## 3. JSX in Vanilla JavaScript (with Babel Standalone)  

### What is Babel Standalone?

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript (ES6+) and JSX into browser-compatible JavaScript. With Babel Standalone, you can use JSX directly in vanilla JavaScript without needing a build step.

**Example:**  
Here’s how you can use JSX in plain JavaScript by including Babel directly in your HTML file:

```html  
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>JSX in Vanilla JS</title>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
        <script type="text/babel">
            const element = (
            <div>
                <h1>Hello from Vanilla JS with JSX!</h1>
                <p>JSX can work in plain JavaScript with Babel.</p>
            </div>
            );

            document.getElementById('root').appendChild(
                // Convert JSX to DOM elements
                (() => {
                    const div = document.createElement('div');
                    ReactDOM.render(element, div);
                    return div;
                })()
            );
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**  
- We include Babel Standalone (`babel.min.js`) in the `<script>` tag.
- The `type="text/babel"` attribute tells Babel to compile the script as JSX.
- In this example, JSX is rendered into the DOM using `ReactDOM.render()`.

### Why Use JSX in Vanilla JS?

- **Learning Purposes:** This setup is useful for experimenting with JSX without setting up a full React or Vue project.
- **Quick Prototyping:** You can quickly prototype ideas without worrying about complex configurations.

## 4. JSX with Other Libraries (e.g., Inferno)  

### What is Inferno?  

[Inferno](https://infernojs.org/) is another lightweight library similar to React and Preact. It also supports JSX, making it easy to switch between these libraries.  

**Example:**  
```jsx  
import { render } from 'inferno';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello from Inferno!</h1>
      <p>Inferno is fast and lightweight, and it supports JSX too.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```  

**Explanation:**  

- Inferno's API is very similar to React, so JSX works almost identically.
- The `render` function mounts the JSX component onto the DOM.  

### Why Use Inferno?  

- **Performance:** Inferno is known for being extremely fast, especially on large applications.
- **Compatibility:** If you’re familiar with React, switching to Inferno should feel natural.

## Conclusion  
JSX is not limited to React—it can be used in various other frameworks and libraries such as Preact , Vue , Inferno , and even vanilla JavaScript with the help of tools like **Babel** .

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Preact :** A lightweight alternative to React that supports JSX natively.
- **Vue :** Supports JSX via the @vue/babel-preset-jsx package, offering more flexibility for complex logic.
- **Vanilla JavaScript :** JSX can be used in plain JavaScript projects with the help of Babel Standalone.
- **Inferno :** Another lightweight library similar to React that supports JSX.  

By understanding how JSX works under the hood, you can leverage it in different environments depending on your project's needs. Whether you're looking for performance, flexibility, or simplicity, JSX can adapt to fit your requirements outside the React ecosystem.
