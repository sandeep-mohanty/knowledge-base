# JSX Tutorial

## What is JSX?

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript, commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX allows us to write HTML-like code in JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize complex UI structures.

### Why use JSX?

- **Readable**: JSX makes your code more readable and expressive by allowing you to write HTML-like elements directly in JavaScript.
- **Component-based architecture**: JSX integrates seamlessly with React's component-based architecture.
- **Efficient**: Under the hood, JSX gets converted into `React.createElement()` calls, which helps optimize rendering performance.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into JSX, ensure that you:
1. Have basic knowledge of JavaScript (ES6+).
2. Understand the basics of React.js.
3. Have Node.js and npm installed on your machine to run React projects locally.

## JSX Syntax Basics

### 1. Embedding Expressions

You can embed any valid JavaScript expression inside curly braces `{}` within JSX.

```jsx
const name = "John Doe";
const greeting = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(greeting, document.getElementById('root'));
```  
In this example, the value of `name` will be dynamically inserted into the `<h1>` tag.

### 2. JSX Elements

JSX looks similar to HTML but is actually syntactic sugar over `React.createElement()`.
```jsx
const element = <h1 className="heading">Hello, World!</h1>;
```   

Notice here that instead of using `class`, we use `className`. This is because JSX transpiles into JavaScript where `class` is a reserved keyword.

### 3. Rendering Multiple Elements  

To render multiple elements, wrap them in a single parent container such as a `div` or a React Fragment (`<>...</>`).

```jsx
const elements = (
  <div>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Some paragraph text.</p>
  </div>
);

// Alternatively, using React Fragments
const fragmentElements = (
  <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Some paragraph text.</p>
  </>
);
```   

### 4. Self-Closing Tags  

Just like in HTML, some JSX tags don't need a closing tag if they donâ€™t contain children:
```jsx
const image = <img src="image.jpg" alt="description" />;
```   

### 5. Attributes in JSX  

Attributes in JSX are written in camelCase. For example, `onclick` in HTML becomes `onClick` in JSX.
```jsx
const button = <button onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>Click Me</button>;
```  

### 6. Conditional Rendering
You can use JavaScript expressions to conditionally render components or elements:  
```jsx
const isLoggedIn = true;

const welcomeMessage = (
  <div>
    {isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please log in.</h1>}
  </div>
);
```  

### 7. Looping with JSX (Rendering Lists)  
You can loop through an array and return JSX elements using `.map()`.
```jsx
const names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];

const listItems = (
  <ul>
    {names.map((name, index) => (
      <li key={index}>{name}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```  
The `key` attribute is necessary when rendering lists to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed.  

### Differences Between JSX and HTML  

While JSX looks like HTML, there are a few important differences:

| FEATURE          | HTML                          | JSX                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Attribute Naming** | `class`                      | `className`                   |
| **Inline Styles**    | Written as strings           | Written as objects            |
| **Self-closing Tags** | Some tags require closing (e.g., `<br>`) | Always self-close non-content tags (e.g., `<img />`) |
| **Event Handling**   | Inline events via `onclick="..."` | CamelCase event handlers (e.g., `onClick={() => {}}`) |

### Example: Inline Styles  

```jsx
const style = {
  color: 'blue',
  fontSize: '20px'
};

const element = <h1 style={style}>Styled Text</h1>;
```  

Here, the `style` object contains CSS properties written in camelCase.  

### Functional Components and JSX  
In React, functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX. They allow you to encapsulate UI logic into reusable pieces.

**Example**  
```jsx  
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Welcome name="John" />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```  
**Explanation**  

-   The `Welcome` function takes `props` as an argument.
-   Inside the function, you return JSX containing the dynamic `props.name`.
-   When rendering, pass the `name` prop to the `Welcome` component.

## Conclusion

JSX is a powerful tool for building user interfaces in React. By combining JavaScript logic with HTML-like syntax, it offers a clean and efficient way to define UI components.

Key Takeaways:
-   JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions using `{}`.
-   JSX uses camelCase for attributes (e.g., `className` instead of `class`).
-   Components are reusable pieces of UI defined as functions that return JSX.
-   Use React Fragments (`<>...</>`) to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes.
