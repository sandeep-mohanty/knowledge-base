## 📌 What is GitOps?

**GitOps** is a modern DevOps practice where **Git is the single source of truth** for declarative infrastructure and application configurations. Any change — including deployments, infrastructure updates, or configuration changes — is made by **modifying code in a Git repository**, which is then **automatically applied** to the system by a GitOps controller.

> GitOps = Git + DevOps + Automation

## ❓ Why Use GitOps?

GitOps brings several benefits over traditional infrastructure and deployment management approaches:

### Benefits:

- **Version-controlled infrastructure**: Every change is tracked in Git with full history.
- **Improved security**: No need to give developers direct access to production clusters.
- **Automation**: Changes are automatically applied by a reconciler (e.g., Argo CD).
- **Faster rollbacks**: Revert a commit to roll back infrastructure or deployments.
- **Auditability**: Every change is transparent and traceable.
- **Collaboration**: Use Git workflows like PRs and code reviews.

## 📐 Key Principles of GitOps

1. **Declarative Infrastructure**  
   The desired system state is described using code (e.g., YAML, Terraform, Helm).

2. **Versioned and Immutable Storage**  
   Git stores the desired state and serves as the source of truth.

3. **Automatic Reconciliation**  
   A GitOps agent automatically applies changes by comparing the actual state with the desired state in Git.

4. **Operational Changes via Pull Requests**  
   All changes go through Git workflows — no manual changes via kubectl or cloud consoles.

---

## 🔄 GitOps Workflow Overview

1. Developer creates a Git branch and makes changes to Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or Terraform files.
2. Developer opens a **pull request** for review.
3. Once approved and merged, Git stores the new desired state.
4. A **GitOps operator** (e.g., Argo CD or Flux) detects the change and **applies** it automatically to the cluster.
5. The operator continuously monitors and **reconciles drift** between Git and the actual cluster state.

## 🧰 Core Components and Tools

| Component          | Examples                        | Description                                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Git Repository     | GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket        | Stores the desired state of infra/apps         |
| CI Tool (optional) | GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI| Optional build/test pipeline                   |
| GitOps Operator    | Argo CD, Flux                    | Applies changes from Git to the cluster        |
| Kubernetes         | EKS, AKS, GKE, OpenShift         | Target infrastructure                          |
| Secrets Management | Sealed Secrets, SOPS, Vault      | Securely handle secrets in GitOps workflows    |

## ⚖️ GitOps vs Traditional CI/CD

| Feature              | Traditional CI/CD                            | GitOps                                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Deployment Trigger   | CI tool pushes to environment                | GitOps operator pulls from Git                 |
| Source of Truth      | Often lives in CI tool config                | Git repository                                 |
| Rollbacks            | Manual or based on CI history                | Git revert and sync                            |
| Access Control       | CI tool or developers have cluster access    | Only GitOps operator has cluster access        |
| Drift Detection      | Manual or not done                           | Automatic reconciliation                       |

> GitOps decouples deployment logic from your CI pipeline, making it more secure and observable.

## 📈 When to Adopt GitOps

GitOps is a good fit when:

- You have **Kubernetes-based deployments**.
- You want to **enforce consistency** across environments.
- Your team already uses **Git workflows** (PRs, reviews).
- You want to **audit and control** all infra changes.
- You are managing **multi-tenant or multi-cluster** environments.

> GitOps is especially beneficial for **platform teams**, **DevSecOps**, and **regulated industries**.

---

## ✅ Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Multi-Environment Kubernetes Management

Use Git branches or folders to manage dev, staging, and prod clusters declaratively.

### 2. Disaster Recovery

Rebuild entire clusters from Git by syncing the desired state.

### 3. GitOps for Infrastructure

Use Terraform with GitOps operators to manage cloud infrastructure (e.g., VPCs, databases).

### 4. Secure Delivery

Use GitOps to deploy apps without giving developers direct access to clusters.

### 5. Compliance and Auditing

Track every infrastructure and application change through Git history.

## 🛠️ Example: GitOps with Kubernetes and Argo CD

### Goal:
Deploy a sample application to Kubernetes using GitOps via Argo CD.

### Tools:
- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, EKS, GKE)
- Git repository with Kubernetes manifests
- Argo CD installed in the cluster

### Steps:

1. **Create a Git repo**  
   Store your Kubernetes manifests in a folder structure like:

   apps/
     └── my-app/
         ├── deployment.yaml
         └── service.yaml

2. **Install Argo CD**  
   Follow the official installation guide to install Argo CD in your Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Register the application with Argo CD**  
   Create a new Argo CD Application either via UI or manifest.

4. **Sync the application**  
   Argo CD detects the app and syncs it to the cluster.

5. **Make a change**  
   Edit the deployment.yaml file (e.g., update image version) and push to Git.

6. **Argo CD auto-syncs the change**  
   The new version is deployed automatically to your cluster.

### Example CLI commands:
```bash
kubectl apply -f app.yaml

kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443

argocd login localhost:8080

argocd app create my-app --repo https://github.com/your-org/your-repo --path apps/my-app --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc --dest-namespace default

argocd app sync my-app
```

## 📋 Best Practices

- Use **branch protections and PR reviews** to control changes.
- Store **secrets encrypted** using Sealed Secrets or SOPS.
- Separate **app code and deployment config** into different repos (optional: mono or multi-repo models).
- Enable **auto-sync and health checks** in Argo CD or Flux.
- Use **Git tags or commit SHAs** to version your deployments.
- Monitor **drift and sync status** using dashboards or alerts.
