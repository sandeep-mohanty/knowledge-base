# 10 Secret Git Commands That Will Save You 5+ Hours Every Week

Git is the backbone of modern software development, but it can also feel like a labyrinth of commands. While `git clone`, `git commit`, and `git push` are your bread and butter, thereâ€™s a whole world of Git commands that most developers never touch. These hidden gems can save you hours, solve tricky problems, and make you look like a Git wizard.

Letâ€™s dive into **10 underrated Git commands** that will transform how you work with version control.

---

## 1. `git restore`: Your Undo Button for Git

Ever messed up a file or accidentally staged something? `git restore` is here to save the day.

```bash
# Discard changes in a file
git restore <file-name>

# Unstage a file (but keep the changes)
git restore --staged <file-name>
```
**Why itâ€™s awesome :** Cleaner and more intuitive than `git checkout` or `git reset`. Think of it as Gitâ€™s version of Ctrl+Z.

## 2. `git switch`: A Smarter Way to Change Branches

Tired of using `git checkout` for everything? `git switch` is purpose-built for branch operations.

```bash
# Switch to an existing branch
git switch <branch-name>

# Create and switch to a new branch
git switch -c <new-branch-name>
```
**Why itâ€™s awesome :** Itâ€™s like having a dedicated tool for branch management instead of a multi-purpose one.

## 3. `git sparse-checkout`: Work Smarter, Not Harder
Working in a massive monorepo? Use `git sparse-checkout` to check out only the files or directories you need.

```bash
# Enable sparse checkout
git sparse-checkout init --cone

# Add specific directories
git sparse-checkout set <dir1> <dir2>
```
**Why itâ€™s awesome :** Perfect for large projects where you donâ€™t need the entire repository. Think of it as cherry-picking files instead of branches.

## 4. `git range-diff`: Compare Commit Ranges Like a Pro
Need to compare two versions of a branch or patch series? `git range-diff` makes it easy.

```bash
git range-diff <commit-range-1> <commit-range-2>
```
**Why itâ€™s awesome :** A game-changer for code reviews and rebasing workflows. No more squinting at diffs trying to figure out what changed.

## 5. `git notes`: Attach Metadata to Commits Without the Mess
Sometimes, a commit message isnâ€™t enough. Use `git notes` to add context without cluttering the commit history.

```bash
# Add a note to a commit
git notes add -m "Your note here" <commit-hash>

# View notes
git log --show-notes
```
**Why itâ€™s awesome :** Like leaving sticky notes on your commitsâ€”helpful, unobtrusive, and easy to manage.

## 6. `git worktree`: Work on Multiple Branches at Once
Switching branches back and forth is a pain. With `git worktree`, you can create separate directories for each branch.

```bash
# Create a new worktree for a branch
git worktree add ../new-directory <branch-name>

# List all worktrees
git worktree list
```
**Why itâ€™s awesome :**  Like having multiple workspaces for your code. No more juggling branchesâ€”just parallel workflows.

## 7. `git bisect`: Find Bugs Like a Detective
Trying to pinpoint when a bug was introduced? `git bisect` performs a binary search through your commit history.

```bash
# Start bisect
git bisect start

# Mark a commit as bad
git bisect bad

# Mark a commit as good
git bisect good <commit-hash>

# Reset when done
git bisect reset
```
**Why itâ€™s awesome :**  Like having a detective on your team, helping you track down bugs with surgical precision.

## 8. `git replace`: Rewrite History Without Breaking Things
Need to fix a historical commit without rebasing? `git replace` lets you create a replacement commit.
```bash
# Create a replacement commit
git replace <old-commit-hash> <new-commit-hash>
```
**Why itâ€™s awesome :**  A non-destructive way to fix mistakes in your history. Think of it as a stealth edit for your commits.

## 9. `git fsck`: Find and Fix Repository Corruption
Worried about repository integrity? `git fsck` checks your repository for errors.
```bash
git fsck --full
```
**Why itâ€™s awesome :** Your first line of defense against repository corruption. Think of it as Gitâ€™s version of a health check.

## 10. `git alias`: Create Your Own Git Commands
Tired of typing long commands? Use `git alias` to create shortcuts.
```bash
# Add an alias
git config --global alias.co checkout

# Use the alias
git co <branch-name>
```
**Why itâ€™s awesome :**  Customize Git to fit your workflow perfectly. Itâ€™s like creating your own cheat codes for version control.

## Deeper Dive: Mastering `git bisect`
Letâ€™s take a closer look at `git bisect`, one of the most powerful yet underused Git commands.

**Scenario**: 
- Your app is crashing.
- The bug wasnâ€™t there last month, but itâ€™s here now.
- You have hundreds of commits to sift through.

Instead of manually checking each commit, `git bisect` automates the process:
```bash
# Start the bisect session
git bisect start

# Mark the current commit as "bad"
git bisect bad

# Mark a known "good" commit (e.g., from last month)
git bisect good <commit-hash>

# Git will automatically check out a commit in the middle. Test your app and mark it as "good" or "bad":
git bisect good  # or git bisect bad

# Repeat until Git identifies the exact commit that introduced the bug.
```
**Pro Tip** : Automate this process by writing a script:
```bash
git bisect run ./test-script.sh
```

## Final Thoughts
Git is more than just commit, push, and pull. These hidden gems can save you time, solve complex problems, and make you a more efficient developer. Whether youâ€™re debugging with git bisect, managing multiple branches with git worktree, or cleaning up history with git replace, these commands are your secret weapons.

So, the next time youâ€™re stuck in a Git rabbit hole, remember: thereâ€™s probably a command for that. Happy coding, and may your merges always be conflict-free! ðŸš€
