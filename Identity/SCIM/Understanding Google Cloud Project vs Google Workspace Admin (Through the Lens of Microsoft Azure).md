# Understanding Google Cloud Project vs Google Workspace Admin (Through the Lens of Microsoft Azure)

When you’re publishing a SCIM + SAML app for Google Workspace, it’s easy to mix up roles like **Google Cloud Project owner** and **Google Workspace Admin**.  
If your team already knows Microsoft Azure / Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), here’s the side-by-side analogy that clears the fog.

## Core Analogy

| Azure / Entra Concept                   | Google Equivalent                         | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Subscription + App Registration** | **Google Cloud Project**                  | Developer container for APIs, Marketplace entries, and OAuth credentials. |
| **Azure AD Global Admin**               | **Google Workspace Super Admin**          | Org IT admin manages users, groups, SSO/SAML apps, and SCIM provisioning. |
| **Azure App Registration** (per app identity) | **OAuth2 Client in Google Cloud Project** | Where you get client IDs/secrets and configure redirect URIs.           |
| **Azure Enterprise Application**        | **Custom App in Google Admin Console**    | Admin integrates a vendor app inside their tenant.                      |
| **Azure AD Gallery App**                | **Google Workspace Marketplace App**      | Vendor-published app, ready for discovery & installation by any admin.  |

## 1. What is a Google Cloud Project?

Think: **Azure Subscription + App Registration combined**

- In **Google Cloud Console**, a **Cloud Project** is your developer container.  
- It holds:  
  - APIs you enable (like the Google Workspace Marketplace SDK).  
  - OAuth credentials (Client ID / Secret).  
  - Your app’s Marketplace listing configuration (name, description, assets).  
- It is organization-agnostic. A Cloud Project belongs to **you as the vendor**, not to your customers.

**Analogy:**  
In Azure, you’d have an **App Registration** under a Subscription. That creates your app identity and holds your credentials. CoolApp’s listing would “live” here.  

---

## 2. What is a Google Workspace Admin?

Think: **Azure AD Global Admin**

- A Google Workspace Admin is an administrator for their organization’s Workspace tenant.  
- Roles:  
  - **Super Admin** (like Azure Global Admin): full powers.  
  - Custom limited-role admins (like Azure custom directory roles): manage apps, users, security.  
- Workspace Admins go to [https://admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com) to:  
  - Add SAML SSO integrations.  
  - Enable SCIM provisioning.  
  - Assign apps to users and groups.  

**Analogy:**  
In Azure, this is your **tenant’s Global Admin** managing apps in their AD portal.

---

## 3. Marketplace vs Gallery

Think: **Azure AD Gallery App ≈ Google Workspace Marketplace App**

- **Azure AD Gallery App:** Vendor publishes app, admins just “Add from gallery.”
- **Google Workspace Marketplace App:** Vendor publishes app to the global catalog. Admins just “Install” from the Marketplace.

**Key Benefit:** Admins don’t need to hand-enter SCIM base URLs or SSO metadata; your listing provides those defaults.

---

## 4. Enterprise Apps vs Custom Apps

- In **Azure**: A Global Admin adds your SaaS app from the Gallery → it shows up as an **Enterprise Application** in their tenant.  
- In **Google**: A Workspace Admin installs your app from the Marketplace (gallery). It shows up under **Apps → Web and mobile apps**.  

**Custom Apps:**  
- In Azure: Admin can create a “non-gallery app” manually.  
- In Google: Admin can create a “Custom SAML App” manually.  

So the split is very parallel.

## 5. SCIM Validation: Microsoft vs Google

- **Microsoft Entra ID:** Has a built-in **SCIM Validator**. Microsoft checks your SCIM endpoints against RFC 7643/7644 compliance during gallery publishing.  
- **Google Workspace:** Does **not** provide a SCIM validator tool.  
  - Google reviewers may test your endpoints manually when reviewing your Marketplace listing.  
  - You must self-validate by testing against RFC standards and through a trial Workspace domain.  

Tools you can use yourself:  
- Postman SCIM API collections.  
- Open-source SCIM test libraries (SCIM-SDK, PowerShell SCIM modules).  

---

## 6. Developer vs Admin Plane

Think of two separate planes of control:

- **Google Cloud Project (GCP)** → like your Azure Subscription/ App Registration.  
  - Developer-facing.  
  - Where you, the vendor, configure APIs, OAuth, and Marketplace entries.  

- **Google Workspace Admin Console** → like your Azure AD/Entra Portal.  
  - Customer/organization-facing.  
  - Where IT admins install your Marketplace app, configure SAML, and enable SCIM provisioning.  

---

## Summary Snapshot

- **Cloud Project = Azure Subscription + App Registration** → where SaaS vendors register and publish apps.  
- **Workspace Admin role = Azure AD Global Admin** → where IT admins install/configure apps for their tenant.  
- **Marketplace = Azure AD Gallery** → global SaaS catalog for discoverable apps.  
- **Custom Apps = Non-gallery Apps** → created tenant by tenant.  
- **SCIM Validation:** Built-in in Azure; manual/test-integration in Google.  

---

## Final Thoughts

If you already know your way around Microsoft Azure:  
- Treat the **Google Cloud Project** like your **dev subscription + App Registration** spot.  
- Treat the **Workspace Admin Console** like your **Entra ID tenant admin portal**.  
- Publishing to **Marketplace** ≈ publishing a **Gallery App** in Azure.  
- Admins consuming your app do so by “installing” in their Console, just like adding an Enterprise App in Azure AD.  

Once you map it this way, publishing and consuming in Google Workspace feels very familiar — just two different ecosystems with slightly different terminology and review processes.
