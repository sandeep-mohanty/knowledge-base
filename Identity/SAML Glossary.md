# Glossary of SAML Terminology

This glossary provides a quick reference for key terms used in the **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** protocol.

---

## 1. **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**
An open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an **Identity Provider (IdP)** and a **Service Provider (SP)**. It enables Single Sign-On (SSO) and federated identity management.

## 2. **Identity Provider (IdP)**
A system or service that authenticates users and provides assertions about their identity to other systems. Examples include Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace.

## 3. **Service Provider (SP)**
A system or application that relies on the IdP to authenticate users. The SP receives SAML assertions from the IdP to grant access to resources. Examples include Salesforce, AWS, and custom web applications.

## 4. **Assertion**
An XML document containing information about the user, such as their identity, attributes, and authentication status. Assertions are generated by the IdP and sent to the SP.
- **Types of Assertions**:
  - **Authentication Assertion**: Confirms the user's identity.
  - **Attribute Assertion**: Provides user attributes (e.g., email, role).
  - **Authorization Decision Assertion**: Specifies whether the user is authorized for a resource.

## 5. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
A feature enabled by SAML that allows users to log in once and access multiple systems without re-authenticating.

## 6. **Single Logout (SLO)**
A feature that allows users to log out of all systems (IdP and SPs) with a single action. It involves sending a **Logout Request** and **Logout Response** between the SP and IdP.

## 7. **Metadata**
XML-based configuration that describes the capabilities and endpoints of the IdP and SP. Metadata includes details like entity IDs, certificate information, and URLs.

## 8. **Entity ID**
A unique identifier for the IdP or SP. It is used to distinguish entities in SAML communications.

## 9. **Binding**
Defines how SAML messages are transmitted between the IdP and SP. Common bindings include:
- **HTTP Redirect Binding**: Messages are sent via URL parameters.
- **HTTP POST Binding**: Messages are sent via HTML form submissions.
- **SOAP Binding**: Messages are sent via SOAP envelopes.

## 10. **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS)**
The endpoint on the SP where SAML responses (assertions) are sent by the IdP after authentication.

## 11. **Single Sign-On Service (SSO)**
The endpoint on the IdP where the SP redirects users for authentication.

## 12. **Single Logout Service (SLO)**
The endpoint on the IdP or SP where logout requests and responses are processed during Single Logout.

## 13. **NameID**
A unique identifier for the user within the SAML protocol. It is included in the assertion and specifies the format of the identifier (e.g., email address, username).

## 14. **NameID Format**
Specifies the format of the `NameID`. Common formats include:
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`: Email address.
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified`: Custom format.
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`: Persistent identifier.

## 15. **SessionIndex**
A unique identifier for a user session. It is used in Single Logout to terminate a specific session.

## 16. **Issuer**
Identifies the entity (IdP or SP) that generated a SAML message. It is included in SAML requests, responses, and metadata.

## 17. **Conditions**
Elements in a SAML assertion that specify constraints, such as validity periods (`NotBefore` and `NotOnOrAfter`) and audience restrictions.

## 18. **Audience Restriction**
Ensures that a SAML assertion is intended for a specific SP. It prevents unauthorized systems from using the assertion.

## 19. **Signature**
A cryptographic signature used to verify the authenticity and integrity of SAML messages. It ensures that the message has not been tampered with and originates from a trusted source.

## 20. **Encryption**
A process used to protect sensitive data in SAML messages (e.g., assertions). Encryption ensures that only the intended recipient can read the message.

## 21. **Artifact Binding**
A binding method where a reference (artifact) is sent instead of the full SAML message. The recipient retrieves the actual message using the artifact.

## 22. **RelayState**
A parameter used in SAML messages to maintain state information across redirects. It is often used to redirect users back to the original resource they were trying to access.

## 23. **Status Code**
Indicates the result of a SAML operation (e.g., success, failure). Common status codes include:
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Success`: Operation succeeded.
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Requester`: Error caused by the requester (SP).
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:status:Responder`: Error caused by the responder (IdP).

## 24. **Federation**
A trust relationship established between an IdP and one or more SPs. Federation allows users from one organization to access services in another organization.

## 25. **Attribute Statement**
A part of the SAML assertion that contains user attributes (e.g., email, role, department). These attributes are used by the SP to make authorization decisions.

## 26. **AuthnContext**
Specifies the context of the authentication event, such as the method used (e.g., password, multi-factor authentication). Example:
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:Password`: Password-based authentication.

## 27. **Key Descriptor**
Describes the public keys used for signing or encrypting SAML messages. It is included in metadata.

## 28. **X.509 Certificate**
A digital certificate used for signing and encrypting SAML messages. It is included in metadata and assertions.
