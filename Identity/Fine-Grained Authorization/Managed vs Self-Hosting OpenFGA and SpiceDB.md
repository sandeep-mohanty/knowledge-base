# Cost Comparison: Managed vs Self-Hosting OpenFGA and SpiceDB

***

## Introduction

When choosing fine-grained authorization systems like OpenFGA or SpiceDB, a critical factor is the **cost** of operating the managed service versus self-hosting.

This guide covers:

- Pricing info for **OpenFGA managed** and **SpiceDB managed**.
- Cost factors in **self-hosting** each solution.
- Key considerations to decide which option is better for your use case.

***

## OpenFGA Managed Pricing

- OpenFGA is offered as a managed SaaS by **Auth0**, part of their Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA) platform.
- Pricing tiers are generally **usage-based**:
  - Number of authorization checks per month.
  - Number of stored relationships (tuples).
  - Concurrent requests and instance sizes (scale).
- Typical pricing examples (subject to change):
  - A free tier with limited requests and storage.
  - Paid tiers scaling from hundreds to millions of requests.
- Full detailed pricing is available in Auth0 FGA subscription plans doc.[1]

### Benefits of Managed OpenFGA

- Zero infrastructure worry: high availability, backups, scaling handled.
- SLA-backed reliability.
- Automatic updates and new features provided.
- Fast time-to-value especially ideal for startups and SMBs.
- Strong integration with Auth0 ecosystem.

### Potential Drawbacks

- Cost rises with usage at scale.
- Reliance on external serviceâ€”data residency and compliance might require scrutiny.
- Less direct control for customization of deployment.

## SpiceDB Managed Pricing

- SpiceDB offers a managed cloud service via **Authzed**, with a range of plans.
- Pricing considers:
  - Number of authorization checks.
  - API usage limits.
  - Data storage size.
  - Additional enterprise features.
- Authzed provides a free tier, development tiers, and enterprise plans discussed on their pricing page.[2]

### Benefits of Managed SpiceDB

- Fully managed with global availability.
- Enterprise-grade SLAs for mission-critical workloads.
- Support for transactional consistency at scale.
- Easy startup with minimal operational complexity.

### Potential Drawbacks

- Similar cost scaling considerations as OpenFGA.
- Enterprise features may come at premium pricing.
- Managed service requires trust in third party for data security.

## Self-Hosting Costs Comparison

Hosting either OpenFGA or SpiceDB yourself means managing:

- Compute resources (VMs, containers).
- Persistent storage (databases like SQLite, Postgres, or CockroachDB).
- Scaling infrastructure for spikes in authorization traffic.
- Backups, disaster recovery, and high availability setup.
- Security patching and monitoring.

### Typical Cost Factors to Consider

| Factor                  | Notes                                               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure (Cloud)  | Compute instances (cloud VMs), storage, networking fees |
| Operational Staff       | Expertise required for deployment, maintenance       |
| Monitoring & Security   | Tools for uptime, audit logging, compliance          |
| Scaling & Resilience    | Load balancers, clustering, backups                   |
| Downtime Risk           | Risk and cost of outages or failures                   |

### When Self-Hosting Makes Sense

- You require full control over data location and compliance.
- Your team has the skills to operate and maintain ReBAC infrastructure.
- Large, predictable steady load that benefits from fixed infrastructure costs.
- You want to avoid recurring SaaS fees at high usage volumes.

### Downsides of Self-Hosting

- Upfront time and expertise required.
- Responsibility for reliability, scaling, and upgrades.
- May be costly or complex at small scale or bursty traffic.

## Which Option is Worth It?

| Use Case                                   | Recommended Option              |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Rapid development, low to moderate scale   | Managed (OpenFGA or SpiceDB)   |
| Highly regulated environments needing full control | Self-host                      |
| Large enterprises with skilled ops teams    | Either, with preference for self-host if cost control is priority |
| Experimentation and proof-of-concept        | Managed, for ease of use       |
| High-volume stable production workloads     | Evaluate total cost of ownership; self-host often cheaper but more effort |

## Final Recommendation

For most teams and projects, especially startups and mid-sized businesses, **managed services** by OpenFGA or SpiceDB provide the best balance of speed, reliability, and total cost of ownership.

Self-hosting is a solid choice if you:
- Have stringent compliance requirements,
- Have a mature operations team,
- Want to optimize costs at very large scale.

Evaluate based on your workload, security posture, and team skills.
