# 📚 Using Logseq With Your Existing Markdown Library  
(*Two Flavors: Local install vs Docker host-based Web UI*)

Logseq will happily devour and re-organize it into a rich, cross-linked knowledge graph.

Here’s how to get started both ways:

---

## 1. Using Logseq Locally (Native Install)

### Step 1 — Install
- Download Logseq from [https://logseq.com](https://logseq.com)  
- Install the `.AppImage` (Linux), `.dmg` (Mac), or `.exe` (Windows).

### Step 2 — Add Your Library as a Graph
- At first run, you’ll be asked to “choose a graph” (that just means “point Logseq to a folder”).  
- Select your **top-level Markdown library** folder (the one containing `README.md` and all those beautiful subject directories).  
- Logseq will scan everything recursively.

For your folder:

```text
KnowledgeVault/
├── README.md
├── AI/
├── Design related/
├── Engineering Disciplines/
├── Essentials/
├── General Knowledge/
├── Identity/
├── Microservices/
├── Personal/
├── Programming & Coding/
├── Testing and Validations/
└── UI and Javascript Ecosystem/
```

Logseq will treat this root folder as your **Graph**.

### Step 3 — Explore
- Pages will be auto-generated from filenames like **`Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).md`** → Page: `Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)`  
- Backlinks appear automatically if you use `[[Linked References]]`.  
- Use the **graph view** to see the network of topics.

---

## 2. Using Logseq in a Docker Container (Browser-based, Multi-device Setup)

### Step 1 — Docker Compose

Create a file `docker-compose.yml` in your server:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  logseq:
    image: ghcr.io/logseq/logseq:latest
    container_name: logseq
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Etc/UTC
    volumes:
      - /home/you/KnowledgeVault:/data  # your host folder of md files
    ports:
      - 0.0.0.0:3000:3000    # expose to LAN
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 2 — Access via Browser
- From your local computer:  
  👉 `http://192.168.1.100:3000` (replace with host’s LAN IP)  
- Select `/data` as the Graph folder.  

Now multiple devices on your LAN (laptop, tablet, phone) can access the same graph in-browser.

### Step 3 — Organize
- All your subfolders (“AI,” “Identity,” “Microservices”) are still visible inside Logseq.  
- You can create **landing pages / index pages** to tie clusters together, for example:

```markdown
# Engineering Index

- [[Platform Engineering]]
- [[GitOps with Terraform]]
- [[Data Engineering]]
- [[Argo CD In-Depth Tutorial]]
```

## 3. How Logseq Handles Your Existing Folder

- **Each Markdown file = A Page**  
  Example:  
  - File: `AI/RAG.md` → Logseq Page: `RAG`  
  - File: `Essentials/Optimize Your Code in Python.md` → Page: `Optimize Your Code in Python`

- **Hierarchical Folder Structure** remains, visible in the sidebar.  
- **Cross-links**: If in `RAG.md` you type `[[Langchain explained]]`, Logseq will automatically establish connections.

---

## 4. Example Transformation of a Page

Suppose you have:

**File:** `AI/RAG.md`

```markdown
# RAG

Retrieval Augmented Generation combines [[Langchain explained]] techniques
with LLM context injection. Related to [[Building AI applications with LLM]].
```

When opened in Logseq:
- Page: **RAG**  
- Shows links → “Langchain explained” and “Building AI applications with LLM”  
- Backlink panels automatically show *where else RAG is mentioned*.  

---

## 5. Workflow Recommendation

### Daily Routine
- Open daily note (`2024-06-15.md`) in Logseq daily journal:
  ```markdown
  - Read [[GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)]]
  - Wrote thoughts on [[Argo CD In-Depth Tutorial]]
  - Need to compare [[GitOps with Terraform]] vs [[Gitops.md]]
  ```

### Periodic Gardening
- Create “Maps of Content” (hub pages) per domain:  
  **AI Overview.md** linking to CNNs, GANs, LangChain, RAG.  
  **Engineering Overview.md** linking to ArgoCD tutorials, Terraform GitOps, Platform Engineering.

### Example MOC Page:

```markdown
# AI Overview

- [[Building AI applications with LLM]]
- [[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)]]
- [[GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)]]
- [[Langchain explained]]
- [[RAG]]
```

## 6. Differences Between Docker & Native

| Feature                         | Native Install              | Docker/Web Hosted                        |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Runs locally offline            | ✅                           | ✅ (but in browser)                       |
| Multi-device LAN access         | Limited (sharing/sync req.) | ✅ Automatic via browser (port 3000)      |
| Performance                     | Faster, more integrated     | Slightly slower depending on server specs |
| Ease of installation            | Simple one click            | Requires Compose and small setup          |
| Cross-app compatibility         | Seamless with filesystem    | Still filesystem-based, no vendor lock-in |

---

## 7. Recommendation 🚀

- If you work mostly on **one machine** → Install Logseq **natively**, point it to your root Markdown folder.  
- If you want **LAN-wide browser access across devices** → Deploy Logseq in **Docker**, bind your markdown folder as `/data`.

Both methods: *your existing markdown tree remains intact*, and Logseq simply layers smart linking, outliner structure, graph visualization, and queries on top of it.

---

# 🌟 Closing Thought

Your current folder system is already a highly organized “library.” By overlaying Logseq:
- Those Markdown scrolls become *living documents*.  
- Each page forms bonds with others, like neurons firing together.  
- Whether native or containerized, you get a **second brain across devices**.

Soon, diving into `GANs.md` might serendipitously surface `Argo CD In-Depth Tutorial.md` because you drew a link — revealing hidden patterns.  

It’s less “filing cabinet of notes” — more “garden of interwoven knowledge.”
